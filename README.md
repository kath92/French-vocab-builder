# French-vocab-builder

This simple program displays a word in French or English (or Polish in my own vocabulary bank), asks the user to translate it and then verifies the answer.

It needs to be developed further as it is lacking features such as handling typos, creating users' own lists, displaying skipped vocabulary
or perhaps having a list of weak/strong words or favourite ones.

The aim is to make this program a Django web application which I am colaborating on with another programmer.
